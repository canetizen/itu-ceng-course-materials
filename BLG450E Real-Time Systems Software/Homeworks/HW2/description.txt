The reliability of real-time systems can be improved with the support of Artificial Intelligence. Even though it is beneficial, it also introduces new challenges from ethical, technical, and security/privacy perspectives.

You are asked to make a literature review on one of the topics in which both real-time and AI concepts/implementations coexist. Since it is an extremely wide and diverse area of research, you are free to find your own topic to focus.

1. Pick your own topic.

2. Select 5-10 papers representing the state-of-the-art form different perspectives.

3. Pay attention to academic (not technological) aspects of the problems in the topic you selected.

4. Explain the topic in your own words in the way you understood in not more than 4000-5000 words in the form of a technical report. (Note that it is not just the summary of the papers.) 

5. Figures, graphs, etc. would be helpful to explain the topic.

Please note that this is not a group assignment and no group work is allowed. You are also not allowed to take professional help and/or benefit from automatic document production tools.

All the best
