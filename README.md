# Istanbul Technical University (ITU) Course Materials

This repository contains materials from the courses I took during my undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University between 2021-2025. The repository may includes materials from other sources such as other GitHub repositories, and Not Kutusu. Source codes and written solutions that are not part of previous years (not located in the "Previous/Past .." folders) belong to me unless otherwise stated. The testing of some assignments is conducted using the Calico tool. You can find the documentation for Calico below.<br>
